      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Pega Certified Senior System Architect (CSSA v8.6) with nearly 3.5 years 
        of enterprise Pega application development experience at Ford Motor Company. 
        I specialize in designing scalable, guardrail-compliant case management 
        solutions using Pega 8.x platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise includes case management, REST integrations, DX API, background 
        processing, external system connectivity, and performance debugging. I have 
        end-to-end SDLC exposure and have collaborated with architects, business 
        stakeholders, QA teams, and cross-functional engineering groups in Agile environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside enterprise workflow engineering, I have completed professional training 
        in Data Analytics and built multiple interactive Power BI dashboards. I have 
        participated in Onyx Data Challenges, completed analytics assignments, and 
        interned with Oasis InfoByte.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently expanding my technical stack by learning Python programming 
        to further strengthen my data engineering and automation capabilities.
